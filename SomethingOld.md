## A new horizon

It may be an urban myth Columbus named the natives Indians thinking he had discovered a new route to India.  
But it summarizes the point of this blogpost in one sentence.  
We can not blame Columbus for making that mistake, he just could not see the whole picture yet.

## About SharePoint Explorers

Hundreds of MVPs discovered the new SharePoint 2016 in alfa and beta releases long before us mortal souls were allowed to take a look at it.
In this new SharePoint world they explored new functionalities, new possibilities and learned new 'stuff'

But like Columbus 

## First knowledge/contact versus new knowledge

Yet Internet culture

Popular blogposts get more 
It is a circle where old knowledge gains more and more attention and new knowledge is like that spring flower trying to grow.
Yet new knowledge is always based and new insights, a clearer picture, and therefor is always better then old knowledge.

It doesn't stop at blogposts, this world is filled with developers copying code from StackOverflow. 
Gurus

Maybe the best option would be to burn it all down, let the ashes fertilize the soil and new crop grow.

## The whole picture

So the next time you hear a person say I am a Microsoft Valued Professional...

Think about Columbus

They may have seen the first picture, but you may question if they learned the whole picture
