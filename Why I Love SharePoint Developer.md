# Why I love MVPs and they hate me
>  **When *Search* can get you *Lost***

Since BPOS (now Office365) I try to stay away from back-end development. I have done my *Tour of Duty* in de SharePoint trenches.  
Office365 brings 100% *Front-End* happiness.

> **Until someone you know asks for your help on "Front-Ends"**

## The Case
Company X was very proud their users actually used SharePoint, and they did so by the thousands. And not just as a File-Share replacement like so many "SharePoint" projects.  
They had News, they had Projects, they had dozens of really worthwhile ContentTypes, they even had good Governance with custom Audience Profiles (something I hardly ever see when they fly me in).  
Workflows were working, Alerts smartly used. Everyone had a good View (pun intended) on SharePoint.  
> **All users were so happy with interfaces adapting to their needs;  
It felt like SharePoint Heaven.**  

Could it really be?
#### Well.. not everyone was happy

A handfull administrators was constantly busy with back-ups and back-ends and back-logs and what not.  
Most of all the IT manager was really worried why the monthly gain of SharePoint popularity came with anonther invoice for yet another *Front-End Server* as those Back-End administrators called them.

Now he is a smart IT guy, so he started to wonder if the external Development Company Y had created this *Front-End* 'heaven' and *Front-End-Server* hell.  
He buys me beer every other week when we discuss IT future in our favourite pub. So I could not really turn him down when he asked me for a second opinion.  
Next monday morning he introduced me as someone who came to audit SharePoint. I first got the *Grand-Tour* into a chilly server room (brings back bad memories of allways coming home with a cold) and witnessed dozens of servers and led-lights blinking 

I declined an *admin* account and requested an *end-user* account first.  
They gave me a 'stupid' terminal session and *tried* to explain to me I would not be able to install any auditing software that way.

## The Situation

My browser opened with the personalized company Intranet Homepage. I was immediatly impressed.  
This looked like the real McCoy.  
Only **minimal changes** were made to the OOTB SharePoint experience, but they were done with care; unlike most SharePoint projects where they start of with blowing 10K on a "Design".  
Some coloring here, some font-changes there. I made a mental note to ask for the Designers name as this girl (*the best ones are*) really deserves a CSS medal.

#### Time to dive into the techy stuff
