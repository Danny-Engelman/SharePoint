## A new horizon

It may be an urban myth Columbus named the natives Indians thinking he had discovered a new route to India.  
But it summarizes the point of this blogpost in one sentence.  
We can not blame Columbus for making that mistake, he just could not see the whole picture yet.

## About SharePoint Explorers

Hundreds of MVPs discovered the new SharePoint 2016 in alfa and beta releases long before us mortal souls were allowed to take a look at it.

In this new SharePoint world they explored new functionalities, new possibilities and learned new 'stuff'

And once the Non-Disclosure-Agreement was lifted they blogged frantically about the new lands and people they met.

We have seen it happen before in 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 

## First knowledge/contact versus new knowledge

Alas the way Internet the works makes this *First Knowledge* stick forever and be perpetuated by new followers.
Popular but old blogposts get more popular over time.  
They are not rewritten like we rewrite history on The Discovery of teh Americas with new finds and insights.

It doesn't stop at blogposts, this world is filled with developers copying code from StackOverflow. 

Alas many SharePoint Gurus left StackOverflow after the novelty wore of and ventured of into new Yammer lands.
Yet their credits remain on StackOverflow and many new travellers are now being guided by 'professionals' who never wrote a letter about SharePoint 2013

## When I am old and wise

Like Columbus had a hard time later in life with new insights, we Consultants and Developers are humans also.

We may have used SharePoint 2016 for the past months.  
But our thoughts, actions and advice are largely guided by old knowledge and old mindsets.

The proof is in the biggest problem with SharePoint: Adoption

> 'They' are stuck in a Yellow-Folder mindset and have a hard time learning something new

## The whole picture

So the next time you hear a person say

> I am a Microsoft Valued Professional since version 2001

Think about Columbus and the Indians

MVPs may have seen the picture first, but you may question if they understand the whole/new picture

We should embrace new knowledge, new insights but above all new people.

It is them who will takes us to the stars, not the MVP in his 1492 sailingvessel.
